# Cirse

### Description 🚀

_This web site was my final project for the course of JavaScript. I decided to create a fake vintage clothes and accesories brand. I've used HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT._
_The challenge was to include a shopping cart but I decided to take a step ahead and add a cart counter, a "sort by" and "filter by" filters and a coupon input before the checkout._

### Tools 🛠️

_This are some of the tools I've used for my project_

* [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Only for Grids
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension to orginize my files
* [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - For animations
* [ANALYTICS] (https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) - Google Analytics
