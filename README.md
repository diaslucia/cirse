# Cirse

## Description 🚀

This web site was my final project for the JavaScript course. I decided to create a vintage clothes and accesories brand for which I've worked with HTML/CSS, SASS, JavaScript and Firebase.

The challenge was to include a shopping cart but I decided to take a step ahead and add a cart counter, "sort by" and "filter by" filters and a coupon input before the checkout.
